SYNC: New Codex update ready
Version/tag: v0.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)

Please review:

- Focus areas (e.g., forms + density)
- Any risks to check (e.g., .post-actions layout)
- Actions row (Save · Export · Print) remains one row down to ~340px; Export shrinks later than side buttons
- Ad spacing: desktop `aside.ad` top spacing equals bottom; mobile `#adMobileTop` unaffected

Decisions needed:

- (list 1–3 questions)

Artifacts:

- ZIP attached (clean: excludes .git and css/\_archive)
- RELEASE_NOTES.md updated (see Changes/Files touched/Tests)
- SELECTOR_MAP.md updated with ownership for `.actions-row`, action button IDs, and `aside.ad`
- PROJECT.md updated with UI patterns for actions row and ad spacing

Notes

- Author: Niels — beginner; please provide step-by-step guidance and clear insertion points.
- Respect selector ownership (see docs/SELECTOR_MAP.md). Keep visual changes explicit.
